Analysis of Santa Cruz County Airbnb Market

This was my first Tableau visualization project, inspired by a few Youtube videos that I watched and my past interest in owning an Airbnb property.

The goal of this project was to analyze the Santa Cruz County Airbnb market to inform decision making about what type of property would perform well as an Airbnb. The two major components I wanted to highlight were the amount of competition for different property sizes, types, and locations, as well as their potential profitability. My visualization focuses on pricing, location, and number of bedrooms, and provides options to filter graphs based on price, location, bedrooms, and property type. Based on the type of property that a host was considering listing as an Airbnb, they can examine how many similar properties already exist, how they are priced, how many reviews they get. The dataset that I used did not have clear booking data, so I chose to use the number of reviews as a quantifier for the number of bookings, with the underlying assumption that the number of reviews positively correlates with the number of bookings.
